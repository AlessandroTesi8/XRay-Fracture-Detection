# X-ray Fracture Detection with Convolutional Neural Networks

![X-ray Fracture Detection]

This project focuses on using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) implemented with PyTorch to detect fractures in X-ray images of hands. While the CNN model exhibits an accuracy of 82%, it's essential to note that the predictions generated by the model may not be entirely reliable for real-world medical applications.

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: This script is the entry point of the project. It reads all the images located in the `quest` folder and provides a verdict based on the CNN model's predictions.

- `cnn_model.py`: This module contains the CNN model class, which defines the architecture of the neural network used for fracture detection.

- `cnn.pth`: The trained CNN model weights are saved in this file. You can load these weights to utilize the pre-trained model.

- `load.py`: This script loads the pre-trained neural network and, given input images, determines whether a fracture is present or not.

- `img_show.py`: This script is used to display images from the dataset for visualization purposes.

- `train.py`: An outdated script that showcases how the neural network was trained. It may not be necessary for regular usage.

## Important Note

The accuracy of the CNN model is reported to be around 82%, but it's crucial to emphasize that the model's predictions should not be solely relied upon for critical medical decisions. Medical image analysis requires a high degree of expertise, and any automated system should be used as an assisting tool rather than a standalone diagnostic solution.

Please consult with medical professionals for accurate fracture detection and diagnosis.

## Usage

To utilize the pre-trained model for fracture detection:

1. Run `main.py` to read and evaluate X-ray images located in the `quest` folder.

2. Use `load.py` to load the pre-trained model and pass images to determine fracture presence.
